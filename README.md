# AlphaZero-Connect4
Implementation of AlphaZero RL algorithm by Deepmind with PyTorch for the game Connect4. It is based on the original paper https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ. 

The implementation was tested on the platform Kaggle and currently has reached aprox. the top 10% (https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/leaderboard). Please keep in mind that the leaderboard is dynamic since competitors upload new solutions continously.
